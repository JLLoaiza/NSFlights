# New Shore Technichal Test - Fullstack Developer

This repository contains a New Shore Technichal Test for Fullstack Developer that integrates the frontend developed in Angular with the backend developed in ASP.NET 8.0. The goal is to create a flight search application that allows users to search for available flights, specify an origin, destination, and a maximum number of flights, and also perform currency conversions using an external API.

## Features

- Angular Frontend: Provides a user interface for users to input flight search criteria and perform currency conversions.

- ASP.NET 8.0 Backend: Offers an /api/Flight/Journey endpoint to search for available flights for a given journey.

- Integration with Swagger: Uses Swagger to document the backend API and allow developers to interactively explore and test the endpoints.

- Integration with Exchange API: Enables users to convert currency values using an external currency exchange API.

- Replacement of recruiting API: Provides the flight data unavailable due the maintenance of the [recruiting flight API](https://recruiting-api.newshore.es/api/flights)
