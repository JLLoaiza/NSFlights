# New Shore Technichal Test - Frontend

This Angular project serves as the frontend for a flight search application. It allows users to search for flights by specifying the origin, destination, and maximum number of flights. The available flights are fetched from the backend server.

Additionally, the frontend provides functionality to convert currency values using an open-source API exposed at [Exchange API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api?tab=readme-ov-file).

# How to start

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
